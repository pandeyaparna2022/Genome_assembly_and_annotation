Course: Genome_and_transcriptome_assembly_and_annotation



The work presented here was carried out in the autumn semester of 2023 for the Genome and Transcriptome Assembly course at the University of Bern and the Organization and Annotation of Eukaryotic Genomes course at the University of Fribourg.

The project aimed to teach the students how to assemble genomes and transcriptomes, but also how to annotate the resulting assemblies. Further, it sought to assess the presence of synteny/ collinearity in five Arabidopsis thaliana subpopulations (An-1, C24, Cvi-0, Ler, and Sha). Raw sequencing data obtained from Jiao and Schneeberger (2020)1. 

# Repository structure
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains a scripts directory and Maker directory.

Scripts directory contains all the scripts used in this course. In the Scripts directory, the Scripts.md file provides detailed information on the execution of scripts.

MAKER directory contains contains the control files that were used in homology-based genome annotation of protein-coding sequences with MAKER.
